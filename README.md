# TV Series Heatmaps
This project aims to create a web scraping package that can be used to scrape all episode information on a TV series from IMDb and export it into a csv for further analysis. I am using the libraries `Requests`, `bs4`, and `pandas` for this project. 

I will also further develop the code to automatically transform the data to prepare it for use in my **Heatmap** visual that I have built using `plotly.express`

## Credits
I would like to credit Matt Barty for his video - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNfxUsQ70QU which served as a guide for the development of my webscraping code.
